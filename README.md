# papelaria
A Java application integrated with a fully illustrated database to simulate a stationery system with registration of books, customers, publishers, and authors.

The login is "admin" with the password 1234.

The database needs to be created with information consistent with the registration pages, since it is only illustrative and does not have CRUD operations for initializing a non-existent database.
